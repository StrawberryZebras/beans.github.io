 <tr>
  <td> Frontside is where you or the board rotates<br> so your are facing the direction of motion.
  <td> Backside is where you or the board rotates <br> so that your back faces the direction of motion.
  <td id="special"> Regular is the <i>stance</i> where your left foot<br> is in front on the board.
  <td> Goofy is when you ride with your right foot first. <br> About half of skaters ride this way.
  <td> Switch is when you ride in the <br> opposite stance (the one that feels weird).
  <td> Fake is when you ride so that <br> you're in your normal stance but you're <br> going backwards. (Your foot's on the tail)
  <td> Nollie is when you ride so that <br> you're in normal stance but with your front <br> foot on the nose.
