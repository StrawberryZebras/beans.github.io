  <ul> Basic Tricks
  <li>Ollie</li>
  <li>Backside Shove-it</li>
  <li>Frontside 180</li>
  <li>Frontside Shove-it</li>
  <li>Nollie</li>
 </ul> <br>

When you start out skating, you'll want to learn the <b>ollie</b> first. This is the most basic trick. <br>
Although <i>some</i> skaters may learn the shove it first, it's less common.
<hr>
<h3 style="text-align:center">The Ollie</h3>

The ollie is the most basic trick because it's the base for all other tricks. The ollie allows you to get your board into the air without <i>grabbing</i> it. <br>
The following images will show the motion of the ollie.

<br>

As the image shows, the power the skater gets to raise the board into the air is the rebounding reaction of the <i>tail</i> being pushed to the ground as the skater jumps.
<br>
The skater then uses their other foot to slide up against the griptape. This frictive force brings the board up further as the skater raises their legs.
<hr>
<h4 style="text-align:center;"> The Shove-It</h4>

The shove-it is the second trick any skater should know. A beginner's shove-it is typically a backside spin, which simplified right now is a counterclockwise rotation. For more

The image below will demonstrate how to perform a shove-it.

<br>
<br>

This image shows how the skater has to slightly push down on the tail and pull it back as they jump so that the board spins 180 degrees.
<br> Professional skateboarders can do high shuvs like this, or even do them down stairsets.
